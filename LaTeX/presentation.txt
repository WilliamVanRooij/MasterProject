Introduction:

Model:

Explain model, y = xB + e, B|g = spike and slab, g|w = Bern(w), w = Beta(a,b)

Process:

    Variationnal inférence:

       Approx. p by q by minimizing KL div.

    Mean-field approximation:

	q(z) = π q_j(z_j)

	CAVI gives local optimum
	
	different optimums depending on initialisation of the parameters

    BAM on the different starting points:
	
	“BAM” basically weighted averaging depending on the prior probe of parameters
	with respect to data.
	
	

R implementation:
